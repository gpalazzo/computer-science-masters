The code inside this repository is more related to labs and exercises done during the classes period.
They're not meant to be an end-to-end (e2e) solution nor be replicable in other environments for another purposes.

Directories' name within the root directory refers to the classes' name, e.g., `applied_econometrics`
directory means the class named as `Applied Econometrics`.

I did a more complete and robust e2e solution as part of the final project in the `Introduction to Operations Research`
class. The project's goal is to optimize a portfolio of assets and it can be found at `https://github.com/gpalazzo/quant-portfolio-opt`.
