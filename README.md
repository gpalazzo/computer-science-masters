The code inside this repository is more related to labs and exercises done during the classes period.
They're not meant to be an end-to-end (e2e) solution or be replicable in other environments or for another purposes.

I did a more complete and robust e2e solution as part of the final project in the `Introduction to Operations Research`
subject. The project's goal is to optimize a portfolio of assets and it can be found at `https://github.com/gpalazzo/quant-portfolio-opt`.
